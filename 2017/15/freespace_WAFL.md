>In the rest of this paper, we discuss the techniques that let WAFL handle
the nondeterministic nature of block free processing in a way that ensures
smooth and determinis- tic system performance.

>This result shows the primary benefit of delete logging, i.e.,
reordering random metadata found in aged file systems so that
it appears to be sequential, as found in unaged file systems.
